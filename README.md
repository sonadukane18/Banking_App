# Banking_App
Banking App is a graphical users interface banking system app like any realistic banking app.  It allows users to register and create new accounts, as well as log in to existing accounts. 

When a user registers, the program prompts them to enter their name, age, gender, and password. It then checks if any of the fields are left empty or if the account already exists.
If everything is valid, a new file with the user's name is created and the user's details are saved in the file. The login function checks if the entered name and password match any existing accounts and opens the account dashboard if they match.

The code uses the os library to list all the files in the directory the script is running in to check for existing accounts and to create new files for new accounts. It also uses the PIL library to handle images, which is not used in the given code snippet.
